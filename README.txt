                A directory backup utility for Windows desktops



                                      NAME

Zekvok: from "zek" and "vok"; correspondingly, the Dovahzul words for "back" and
"up".



                                  DESIGN GOALS

The primary design goals are, in no particular order:

* Transparency
* Security
* Efficiency

Backup TRANSPARENCY refers to the property that a backup should be, as much as
possible and/or practical, capable to be restored into an exact duplicate of the
data that was originally backup up.

Backup SECURITY is essential if the data being backed up is sensitive,
particularly if it's desirable to upload the backup to a cloud storage service.
Security covers both the ability to secure a backup from unauthorized readers,
and to detect malicious or accidental modifications. A properly secure backup
can be safely handed to an untrusted party for safekeeping.

Backup EFFICIENCY, while not as critical as the former two, is necessary if
frequent backups are desirable, doubly so if the dataset is large, octuply so if
the backup will be transferred over the Net. A smart system capable of trimming
away redundancies makes highly redundant backups feasible.



                                    FEATURES

Currently, all file system object types supported by both NTFS and Windows Vista
to 10 are supported, including:

* Regular files
* Regular directories (folders)
* File symbolic links
* Directory symbolic links
* Directory reparse points (junctions)
* Hardlinks

Note: NTFS also appears to support file reparse points, but as of this writing
no version of Windows supports this type of file system object.

Link-like file system objects are backuped up as links, storing their link
targets in the backup. Links to files don't create duplicate data, and links to
directories are not followed, nor are their targets traversed.
In the future, it will be possible to automatically add link targets as backup
sources, if they're not otherwise covered by any other backup source.

There are no known limits on path length or directory nesting. Paths as long as
2300 characters long and as deep as 50 levels deep have been successfully
tested.

Currently, the following NTFS features are neither backed up nor restored:

* Alternate data streams
* Access control lists
* File attributes (the archive flag is queried to optimize backup creation)
* File times (modification time is backup up to optimize backup creation)

                                  Backup modes

The following backup functionality is supported:

* Full backups
* Incremental backups (At file level. If a file is detected to have changed, a
  complete copy of the new version is backed up.)
* Whole-version compression (LZMA)
* Backing up files in use by other programs (Volume Shadow Service required)
* Transacted backup creation (The backup storage will never be left in an
  inconsistent state, even if the backup process is interrupted by a power
  failure.)



                                PLANNED FEATURES

* More user-friendliness
* Public-key-based backup encryption
* Block-level incremental backups (If a file is changed, only the portions that
  actually changed will be backed up.)
* Block- or file-level deduplication and move/rename detection



                          LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN ISSUES

* VSS does not work with nested file systems (e.g. an NTFS volume in a VHD
  stored in an NTFS volume, or an NTFS volume in a TrueCrypt volume in an NTFS
  volume). However, with block-level incremental backups, it will be possible to
  make space-efficient backups of virtual hard disks, although encrypted file
  systems are incompressible.

* Backing up locked files in a network share is not supported.

* Transacted writes to network shares are not supported. Writing the backup
  files to a network share will work, but the process will not be transacted.
  This means that the backup version that was being generated may be left
  incomplete, and thus corrupted, in case of a power failure on either machine.
  Once power is restored, it is possible to run a verification on the archive
  and clean up broken files.

* Hardlinks are detected by examining and generating file GUIDs. When using VSS,
  it is possible for the situation to arise that one of two files (both of which
  were hardlinks with each other at the time the VSS snapshot was taken) may be
  deleted after the VSS snapshot is taken but before the file GUIDs are
  generated. If this happens, the two files may be treated as two unrelated
  regular files and stored redundantly.



                                     USAGE

Currently, the interface is an in-process command-line. Using the program
involves typing in commands for it to perform. The program must be run as an
administrator for much of its functionality to be available.

Accepted commands:

open <path>
	Creates a backup object that will generate archive files at <path>.

add <path>
	Adds <path> to a list of sources in the backup object. Files and directory
	structures will be read from here.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

exclude extension <extension>
	When creating the backup, all files of the given extension will be ignored.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

exclude path <path>
	When creating the backup: if <path> is a file, it will not be backed up; if
	it's a directory, its contents will not be backed up.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

exclude name <name>
	When creating the backup, all file system objects named <name> will not be
	backed up.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

backup
	Perform the backup.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

restore
	WARNING: THIS COMMAND OVERWRITES FILES WITHOUT ASKING FOR CONFIRMATION.
	Restore a backup. The destination is set to the source from which the backup
	was generated.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

select version <number>
	Selects a backup version. 0 is the first version, 1 is the second version,
	-1 is the latest version, -2 is the second latest version.
	When the "open" command is issued, the selected version is automatically set
	to -1.
	This command modifies the behavior of various other commands. E.g. "restore"
	will restore the selected version.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

show dependencies
	Shows a list of the versions which are required to restore the selected
	version.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

show versions
	Shows a list of all available versions.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

show version_count
	Shows a count of all available versions.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

show paths
	Shows a detailed list of the contents of a backup.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

if <variable> <command>
	If <variable> was passed to the program as a command-line argument,
	<command> will be executed.

set use_snapshots {true|false}
	Defaults to true. If false, snapshots will not be used when performing the
	backup. This can speed up the backup if backup consistency is guaranteed by
	other mechanisms, and it's also required when backup up certain kinds of
	volumes.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

set change_criterium {archive_flag|size|date|hash|hash_auto}
	Sets the criterium that is used to determine when a file has changed.
	archive_flag: Only check if the archive flag is set.
	size: Only check if the size is different.
	date: Only check if the modification time is different.
	hash: Check if the SHA-256 digest is different.
	hash_auto: Check the digest for small files, and check the date for lerger
	files.
	The default is hash_auto.
	This command will fail if no "open" commands have been previously issued.

verify
    Checks the integrity of the selected version. This check is only intended to
    protect against accidental storage/transmission errors, NOT against
    malicious modifications.

verify full
    Does the same as verify, but also checks all dependencies of the selected
    version. Again, this check offers NO protection against malicious
    modifications.
